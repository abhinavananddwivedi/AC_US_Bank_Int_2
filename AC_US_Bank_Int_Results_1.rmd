# Further Tests to Do:
# 1. Make integration histograms for all banks, find empirical distribution
# 2. Is there core-periphery relationship now?
# 3. Fit time trends to median and individual banks' integration.
# 4. Why are there many left tail outliers in crisis periods? Relation to crises?
# 5. How do D-SIBs and G-SIBs behave?
# 6. What is median eigenvector explanatory power? Plot to confirm.
# 7. How does bank integration vary with SIC codes? 
# 8. Why does PCA capture integration? Improve Puk and Roll's answer.
