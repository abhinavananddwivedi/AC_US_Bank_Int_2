# Further Tests to Do:

# 4. Why are there many left tail outliers in crisis periods? Relation to crises?
# 5. How do D-SIBs and G-SIBs behave?
# 7. How does bank integration vary with SIC codes? 
# 8. Why does PCA capture integration? Improve Puk and Roll's answer.
# 9. What are the identities of the left tail outliers in the boxplots?
# 10. Correlation between quarterly integration and quarterly returns?
# 11. How do factor loadings evolve? (Brennan question)
